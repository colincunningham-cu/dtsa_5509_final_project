# DTSA 5509 Final Project

## Project Overview
This project utilizes linear regression techniques to predict housing prices in Ames, Iowa. Linear regression is widely used to predict housing prices due to its interpretability and the perceived linear relationship between the independent variables (# bedrooms, # bathrooms, etc.) and the dependent variable (house price). This allows prospective home buyers to evaluate the price of a home by comparing the asking price to the sale price of homes with similar features. Though this study is limited to houses in Ames, Iowa, the analysis can be extended to evalute home prices across other towns/regions.

The goal of this project is to provide insights into the impact of each feature on the house price, enabling homebuyers to understand the significance of different factors and make informed decisions in the real estate market.

## Data Overview
The data used for this project was downloaded from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview) and contains 1,460 observations with 80 features (not including ID) that describe almost every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa. In total, there are 28 quantitative variables and 52 categorical variables.

## Results & Conclusions
